	<name>Rule Engine Variable (Dictionary)</name>
	<shortDescription>
		 Applies user-defined (in a table) business rules to the flow variables
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node takes a list of user-defined rules and tries to match them
			to the defined flow variables. If a rule matches, its outcome value
			will become the value of the flow variable.
			The first matching rule will determine the outcome.
			<p>
				Each rule is represented by a row.
				The comments start with
				<tt>//</tt>
				in a condition cell, and anything after that is not interpreted as a rule in
				that row.
				Rules consist of a condition part (antecedent), which must
				evaluate to
				<i>true</i>
				or
				<i>false</i>
				, and an outcome (consequent, after the =&gt; symbol) which is put into
				the new flow variable if the rule matches.
			</p>
			<p>The outcome of a rule can either be a constant string, a constant
				number or boolean constant, or a reference to a flow
				variable value.
				The type of the outcome column is the common super
				type of all
				possible
				outcomes (including the rules that can never
				match).
				If no
				rule matches, the outcome is "", 0, or 0.0 depending on the output
				type.
			</p>
			<p>
				Numbers are given in the usual decimal representation. Note that
				strings must not contain (double-)quotes (for those cases use the following syntax: <tt>/Oscar Wilde's wisdom: "Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes."/</tt>). The flow variables are
				represented by
				<b>$${</b>
				TypeCharacterAndFlowVarName
				<b>}$$</b>
				.
				The TypeCharacter should be 'D' for double (real) values, 'I' for
				integer values and 'S' for strings.
			</p>
            <p>The logical expressions can be grouped with parentheses. The
                precedence rules for them are the following: <tt>NOT</tt> binds most, <tt>AND</tt>,
                <tt>XOR</tt> and finally <tt>OR</tt> the least.
                Comparison operators always take
                precedence over logical connectives.
                All operators (and their names)
                are case-sensitive.
            </p>

			<p>Some example rules (each should be in one row):</p>
			<pre>
// This is a comment
$${DFlowVar0}$$ > 0 => "Positive"
</pre>
			FlowVar0 has value above zero, which case the result flow variable
			has the value Positive.
			<pre>
$${SFlowVar0}$$ = "Active" AND 
    $${IFlowVar1}$$ &lt;= 5 => "Outlier"
</pre>
			When FlowVar0 is "Active" and FlowVar1 is greater or equal to 5, then
			the result is Outlier.
			<pre>
$${SFlowVar0}$$ LIKE "Market Street*" AND 
    ($${SFlowVar1}$$ IN ("married", "divorced") 
        OR $${IFlowVar2}$$ > 40) => "Strange"
</pre>
			The logical connectives help express complex conditions.
			<pre>
$${SFlowVar10}$$ MATCHES $${SFlowVar0}$$ OR $${DFlowVar2}$$ &lt; $${IFlowVar1}$$ =>
    $${SFlowVar0}$$
</pre>
			You can compare different flow variables.
			
			<p>
				The NaNs equal to other NaN values (other values are neither less, nor
				greater or equal to NaN values).

        <option name="Rules column">Name of the column in the second input table containing the rules or just the conditions if an outcome column is also selected. In case the rules are available during configuration, the type of the outcome column is shown at the right end of this configuration row.</option>
        <option name="=>">In case your rules are in two separate columns (condition and outcome), this should be the column containing the outcome values. (Ignored for the comment -starting with <tt>//</tt>- conditions. In case it contains missing value for non-comment conditions, the output type will be String!) For String columns the outcome should not be quoted (by <tt>"</tt> or by <tt>/</tt>)</option>
        <option name="Treat values starting with $ as references">When checked, the values in string -outcome- column starting with <tt>$</tt> are not treated as string constants with that value, but are tried to be parsed as references to flow variables, columns or table properties.</option>
		<option name="Result variable">Name of the new flow variable,
			which contains the
			outcome of the rules.
		</option>
        <option name="Errors">The errors found in the input table parsing the rules column</option>
        <option name="Warnings">The warnings found in the input table parsing the rules column</option>
